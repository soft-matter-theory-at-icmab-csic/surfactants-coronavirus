# surfactants-coronavirus-AA
Files for the all-atom simulations between SARS-CoV-2 virus and surfactants.

- spike-ctb12-initial.pdb.gz: PDB file coresponding to the initial structure of the spike protein inserted into the membrane and CTB12 surfactants.

- spike-ctb12-initial.psf.gz: PSF file coresponding to the initial structure of the spike protein inserted into the membrane and CTB12 surfactants.

- spike-sds-initial.pdb.gz: PDB file coresponding to the initial structure of the spike protein inserted into the membrane and SDS surfactants.

- spike-sds-initial.psf.gz: PSF file coresponding to the initial structure of the spike protein inserted into the membrane and SDS surfactants.

- SMD_harmonic.in: Input file used to perturb SDS surfactants over the spike protein. A collective variable is defined for each surfactant we are steering.
